THIS PROJECT IS RELATED TO THE FACE ATTENDANCE SYSTEM...
IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE ON PERFORMING THIS TASK..
THERE ARE THE SEVERAL DIFFICULTIES WHICH I FACED DURING THE PROJECT...
THE MAZOR OF THEM IS :
HOW TO IMPORT DILLIB FILE: FOR THIS I REQUIRED BINARY  FILE
AND SECOND HOW TO ADD THE GUI AND TO INTEGRATE IT WITH MY CODE..

FOR ME IT WAS REALLY A TOUGH TASK.. 
BUT MY MENTOR - AAMIR SIR AND CO-MENTOR PAWAN SIR HELPED ME A LOT...EVEN MORE THAN EXPECTED.

REALLY A GREAT FUN WITH THE BOOTCAMP...
THANKYOU SCHOOL OF AIML
