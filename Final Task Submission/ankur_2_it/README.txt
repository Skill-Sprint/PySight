The first python file contains the implementation of the opencv and mediapipe for counting the number of fingers.
The second python file uses the functions for counting the number of fingers in the tkinter application.

Mind to run the first basic implementation based python file because accuracy in the first basic implementation based application is more than the tkinter application but could be adjusted by changing the
threshold values.
