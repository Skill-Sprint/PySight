This is a multi-recognition attendance system build using python opencv and tkinter for GUI.Before starting, Kindly update the photos of the person you need to identify & Do update the code before using according to the photo's location and their names.
The issues i faced regarding and while making this project were:-
1. installation in face recognition library & dlib.
2. interpreter problem
3. ultralytics 
 and some minor issues with the code editor.

 With the help of mentor's and online resources it was easy to overcome all the obstacles.
# to resolve the librarry issue i simply changed the interpreter from idle to anaconda which helped me in the installation of ultralytics but face recognition was still the problem. so, to resolve that i installed the visual studio build tools and added it in my environment system.

# There's a small GUI which will help the user to interact with code and mark the attendance of inserted people.
HOPE IT HELP'S YOU!
