## SPOT THE DIFFERENCE GAME: Using Mouse Events
This project is a fun game to spot differences between two pre downloaded images by drawing rectangles over them using Mouse Events. People can then view the correct answer by clicking a certain key.

*ABOUT THE PROJECT*

In this project, I pre-downloaded 2 images and using mouse events, rectangles can be drawn over these images and also the color of the rectangles can be changed by using a color trackbar.
If a user enters "A" then the answer window will pop-up. 
If he/she enters"Q" then the user exits from the program.

*PRE-REQUISITES FOR THIS PROJECT*

- opencv-python package
- numpy package
- a deep understanding of python
- a good grasp on mouse events

HOPE YOU ENJOY THE GAME!
